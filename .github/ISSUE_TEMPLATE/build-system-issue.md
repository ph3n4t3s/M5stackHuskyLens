# Build System Issue

## Current Behavior
The project currently fails to compile due to multiple issues with the ESP Async WebServer dependency and resource-intensive compilation process.

## Expected Behavior
- Clean compilation without dependency conflicts
- Reasonable CPU/memory usage during builds
- Proper header file resolution

## Technical Details

### Dependency Issues
- Conflicts between ESPAsyncWebServer-esphome and ESPAsyncWebServer
- Missing header files (ESPAsyncWebSrv.h)
- Version mismatch in AsyncTCP dependencies

### Build Process Issues
- High CPU usage during compilation
- Excessive memory consumption
- Long build times

### Current Configuration
```ini
platform = espressif32
framework = arduino
board = esp32-s3-devkitc-1
lib_deps = 
    ottowinter/ESPAsyncWebServer-esphome
    ottowinter/AsyncTCP-esphome
    # Other dependencies...
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pio run -e esp32-s3-dev`
3. Observe compilation errors related to ESPAsyncWebSrv.h
4. Monitor system resources during compilation

## Error Messages
```
src/api/SecurityRoutes.h:3:10: fatal error: ESPAsyncWebSrv.h: No such file or directory
#include <ESPAsyncWebSrv.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
compilation terminated.
```

## Proposed Solutions
1. Create a WebServer adapter layer (implemented)
2. Update platformio.ini configuration
3. Review and update dependency versions
4. Implement build optimization strategies

## Environment
- OS: Ubuntu
- PlatformIO Core: latest
- Framework: Arduino for ESP32
- Board: ESP32-S3

## Additional Context
This issue is blocking the main development workflow and needs to be addressed before proceeding with other features.
